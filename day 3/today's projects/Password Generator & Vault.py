# Project 3: Password Generator & Vault 🔐
# Concepts: Functions, String Operations, Error Handling

















# Security Note: This is for learning purposes only - real password managers use encryption!

# Key Learning Outcomes:
# ✅ Functions for organized, reusable code
# ✅ Dictionaries to manage complex data relationships
# ✅ Real-world applications (e-commerce, security, personal organization)

# Pro Tip: Try combining these projects - e.g., add a "wishlist" feature to the library manager using the shopping cart logic!
