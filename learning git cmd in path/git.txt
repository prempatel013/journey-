=>✅ Situation: You staged changes but didn’t commit yet
    (i.e., you ran git add but didn’t git commit)

Undo staging:

-> git reset


===>✅ Situation: You already committed but want to undo the commit


==>Option 1: Undo the last commit (keep your changes as unstaged)
 
      ----->  git reset --soft HEAD~1
                ->"Go back 1 commit but keep all the code in working directory and staging area."



==>Option 2: Undo last commit and keep changes as uncommitted

      ------>git reset --mixed HEAD~1
            ->Removes the commit, keeps changes as unstaged.

==>Option 3: Undo last commit and discard all changes


    =========>⚠️ Dangerous: This erases everything from that commit:

 
            --->git reset --hard HEAD~1


        --->🧠 Tip: Always check status before doing destructive commands

        ===>git status
